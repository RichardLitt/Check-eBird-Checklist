Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.
We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Too Long Distance</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S70089161' target='_blank'>S70089161</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it as an usually high distance. While it is acceptable to make a checklist of up to 80km according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, more precise checklists are more valuable for science. It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

Your checklist(s) was flagged because it is a complete checklist and we suspect that not all birds were reported. While this might be correct, we wanted to double check whether birding was indeed your primary purpose and that you have recorded all the birds around you to the best of your abilities.

Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.
We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Only One Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S24327036' target='_blank'>S24327036</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S58828655' target='_blank'>S58828655</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S58779186' target='_blank'>S58779186</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it is a complete checklist with only a single species. While this might be correct, we wanted to double check with you that birding was indeed your primary purpose and you recorded all the birds around you to the best of your abilities. (Please refer to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748-birding-as-your-primary-purpose-and-complete-checklistss">eBird support help page</a> for more information). If not, you can change the protocol to 'Incidental' or mark your list as 'Incomplete'.

It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives.

Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.
We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Only One Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S15152382' target='_blank'>S15152382</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S16473165' target='_blank'>S16473165</a>

<b>Same Count All Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S16429482' target='_blank'>S16429482</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because all species were recorded with the same count.

<b>Too Long Distance</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S66034647' target='_blank'>S66034647</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S66660650' target='_blank'>S66660650</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S68783746' target='_blank'>S68783746</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S69143856' target='_blank'>S69143856</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S68308598' target='_blank'>S68308598</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S74660262' target='_blank'>S74660262</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S75089433' target='_blank'>S75089433</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it as an usually high distance.

It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Only One Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S19841956' target='_blank'>S19841956</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it is a complete checklist with only a single species. While this might be correct, we wanted to double check with you that birding was indeed your primary purpose and you recorded all the birds around you to the best of your abilities. (Please refer to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748-birding-as-your-primary-purpose-and-complete-checklistss">eBird support help page</a> for more information). If not, you can change the protocol to 'Incidental' or mark your list as 'Incomplete'.

Your checklist(s) was flagged because it as an usually high distance.

It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.
We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Too Long Distance</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S32182733' target='_blank'>S32182733</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it as an usually high distance. While it is acceptable to make a checklist of up to 80km according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, more precise checklists are more valuable for science. It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Same Count All Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S46395884' target='_blank'>S46395884</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S46497212' target='_blank'>S46497212</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because all species were recorded with the same count. We wanted to double check with you that these counts are indeed correct (see more on <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000838845">how to count birds with eBird</a>). If you did not count the birds, you can udpate the count to "X".

We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Too Long Distance</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S100437864' target='_blank'>S100437864</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S100437616' target='_blank'>S100437616</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it as an usually high distance. While it is acceptable to make a checklist of up to 80km according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, more precise checklists are more valuable for science. It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.
We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Only One Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S50119432' target='_blank'>S50119432</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it is a complete checklist with only a single species. While this might be correct, we wanted to double check with you that birding was indeed your primary purpose and you recorded all the birds around you to the best of your abilities. (Please refer to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748-birding-as-your-primary-purpose-and-complete-checklistss">eBird support help page</a> for more information). If not, you can change the protocol to 'Incidental' or mark your list as 'Incomplete'.

Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.
We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Only One Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S56659840' target='_blank'>S56659840</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it is a complete checklist with only a single species. While this might be correct, we wanted to double check with you that birding was indeed your primary purpose and you recorded all the birds around you to the best of your abilities. (Please refer to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748-birding-as-your-primary-purpose-and-complete-checklistss">eBird support help page</a> for more information). If not, you can change the protocol to 'Incidental' or mark your list as 'Incomplete'.

<b>Too Long Distance</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S56486707' target='_blank'>S56486707</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it as an usually high distance. While it is acceptable to make a checklist of up to 80km according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, more precise checklists are more valuable for science. It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

<b>Too Fast</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S56486707' target='_blank'>S56486707</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because we suspect a potential issue with the distance and duration entered. Could you double check the values entered and verify the validity of the protocol selected according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>?

It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

While it is acceptable to make a checklist of up to 80km according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, more precise checklists are more valuable for science. It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.
We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Multi Day</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S60046246' target='_blank'>S60046246</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because of its unusually high duration. According to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, checklists should <b>correspond to a single calendar date and should not span multiple days</b>.

<b>Not Stationary</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S72693368' target='_blank'>S72693368</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because we suspect that the stationary protocol might not be adequate. Can you check the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859-guide-to-ebird-protocols#anchorStationary">guide to eBird protocol</a> and adjust the protocol if necessary? If you're unable to estimate the distance covered, the Historical protocol would be a good choice.

Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.
We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Same Count All Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S62996181' target='_blank'>S62996181</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because all species were recorded with the same count. We wanted to double check with you that these counts are indeed correct (see more on <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000838845">how to count birds with eBird</a>). If you did not count the birds, you can udpate the count to "X".

It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Too Long Distance</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S72804142' target='_blank'>S72804142</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it as an usually high distance. While it is acceptable to make a checklist of up to 80km according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, more precise checklists are more valuable for science. It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.
We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Multi Day</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S77393940' target='_blank'>S77393940</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because of its unusually high duration. According to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, checklists should <b>correspond to a single calendar date and should not span multiple days</b>.

It is therefore recommended to keep Traveling checklists under 8 km and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or 1.5 km provides even more checklist precision! Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

We performed some automatic checks and the following checklists were identified as having potential issues with protocols. We detail below for each of them what might be incorrect and how to fix them.

<b>Only One Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S49276717' target='_blank'>S49276717,S49287267</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it is a complete checklist with only a single species. While this might be correct, we wanted to double check with you that birding was indeed your primary purpose and you recorded all the birds around you to the best of your abilities. (Please refer to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748-birding-as-your-primary-purpose-and-complete-checklistss">eBird support help page</a> for more information). If not, you can change the protocol to 'Incidental' or mark your list as 'Incomplete'.

<b>Complete Media</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S49276717' target='_blank'>S49276717,S49287267</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it is a complete checklist and we suspect that not all birds were reported. While this might be correct, we wanted to double check whether birding was indeed your primary purpose and that you have recorded all the birds around you to the best of your abilities.

<b>Not Stationary</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S49400163' target='_blank'>S49400163,S49418373</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because we suspect that the stationary protocol might not be adequate. Can you check the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859-guide-to-ebird-protocols#anchorStationary">guide to eBird protocol</a> and adjust the protocol if necessary? If you're unable to estimate the distance covered, the Historical protocol would be a good choice.

<b>Only One Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S8562055' target='_blank'>S8562055,S8563149</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S8562746' target='_blank'>S8562746,S8563154</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because it is a complete checklist with only a single species. While this might be correct, we wanted to double check with you that birding was indeed your primary purpose and you recorded all the birds around you to the best of your abilities. (Please refer to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748-birding-as-your-primary-purpose-and-complete-checklistss">eBird support help page</a> for more information). If not, you can change the protocol to 'Incidental' or mark your list as 'Incomplete'.

<b>Same Count All Species</b>: <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S8579687' target='_blank'>S8579687,S8579690</a>
Your checklist(s) was flagged because all species were recorded with the same count. We wanted to double check with you that these counts are indeed correct (see more on <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000838845">how to count birds with eBird</a>). If you did not count the birds, you can udpate the count to "X".


Best wishes,
