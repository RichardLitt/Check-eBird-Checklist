Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S101256219' target='_blank'>S101256219</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S101256096' target='_blank'>S101256096</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S101256289' target='_blank'>S101256289</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S101255657' target='_blank'>S101255657</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S101255731' target='_blank'>S101255731</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because we suspect that the Stationary protocol is incorrectly used. Can you check the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859-guide-to-ebird-protocols#anchorStationary">guide to eBird protocol</a> and adjust the protocol as necessary? If you're unable to estimate the distance covered, the Historical protocol might be the most adapted. 

Could you please let me know when you have made the appropriate correction so I can set the checklist as public again?

Thanks in advance, 

Raphaël Nussbaumer
