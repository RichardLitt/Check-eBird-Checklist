Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S52258989' target='_blank'>S52258989</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S52258990' target='_blank'>S52258990</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S52259018' target='_blank'>S52259018</a>

In particular, there seems to be an issue with the start time of your checklist. Would you mind verifying your checklist?

Potential issues can be a confusion between AM/PM or a wrong start time. If no start time is available, the checklist protocol should be <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859-guide-to-ebird-protocols#anchorHistorical">historical</a> if birding was a <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748-birding-as-your-primary-purpose-and-complete-checklists">primary purpose</a> or <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859-guide-to-ebird-protocols#anchorIncidental">incidental</a> if birding was not your primary purpose. In both cases, you can leave the time field empty. 

Could you please let me know if the time was originally correct, or if you have now corrected it, so that I can set the checklist as public again? 

Thanks in advance,

Raphaël Nussbaumer
