Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S47544051' target='_blank'>S47544051</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S47544047' target='_blank'>S47544047</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S47727659' target='_blank'>S47727659</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because all species were recorded with the same count. We wanted to double check with you that these counts are indeed correct (see more on <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000838845">how to count birds with eBird</a>).

If you did not count the birds, you can udpate the count to "X".

Could you please let me know when you have made the appropriate correction so I can set the checklist as public again?

Thanks in advance, 

Raphaël Nussbaumer

Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S8579687' target='_blank'>S8579687,S8579690</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because all species were recorded with the same count. We wanted to double check with you that these counts are indeed correct (see more on <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000838845">how to count birds with eBird</a>).

If you did not count the birds, you can udpate the count to "X".

Could you please let me know when you have made the appropriate correction so I can set the checklist as public again?

Thanks in advance, 

Raphaël Nussbaumer

Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S50941054' target='_blank'>S50941054</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because all species were recorded with the same count. We wanted to double check with you that these counts are indeed correct (see more on <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000838845">how to count birds with eBird</a>).

If you did not count the birds, you can udpate the count to "X".

Could you please let me know when you have made the appropriate correction so I can set the checklist as public again?

Thanks in advance, 

Raphaël Nussbaumer
