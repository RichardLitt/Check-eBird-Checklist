Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S40059187' target='_blank'>S40059187</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S88004609' target='_blank'>S88004609</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S87968025' target='_blank'>S87968025</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S73708971' target='_blank'>S73708971</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because it is a complete checklist with only a single species. While this might be correct, we wanted to double check with you that birding was indeed your primary purpose and you recorded all the birds around you to the best of your abilities. (Please refer to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748-birding-as-your-primary-purpose-and-complete-checklistss">eBird support help page</a> for more information).

If not, you can change the protocol to 'Incidental' or mark your list as 'Incomplete'.

Could you please let me know when you have made the appropriate correction so I can set the checklist as public again?

Thanks in advance,

Raphaël Nussbaumer

Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S66033075' target='_blank'>S66033075</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S68778370' target='_blank'>S68778370</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because it is a complete checklist with only a single species. While this might be correct, we wanted to double check with you that birding was indeed your primary purpose and you recorded all the birds around you to the best of your abilities. (Please refer to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748-birding-as-your-primary-purpose-and-complete-checklistss">eBird support help page</a> for more information).

If not, you can change the protocol to 'Incidental' or mark your list as 'Incomplete'.

Could you please let me know when you have made the appropriate correction so I can set the checklist as public again?

Thanks in advance,

Raphaël Nussbaumer
