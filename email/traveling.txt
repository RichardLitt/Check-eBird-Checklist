Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S76601963' target='_blank'>S76601963</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S78312588' target='_blank'>S78312588</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because it has a Traveling protocol with a distance smaller than 30m. According to <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859-guide-to-ebird-protocols#anchorTraveling">the guide to eBird protocols</a>, checklists with a distance smaller than 30m should be set as Stationary. 

Can you check that the distance is not a typo (e.g, 0.01 instead of 0.1) or change the protocol to Stationary?

Please let me know when you have made the appropriate correction so I can set the checklist as public again.

Thanks in advance, 

Raphaël Nussbaumer
