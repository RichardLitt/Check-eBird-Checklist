Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklists(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S50481348' target='_blank'>S50481348</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because they contain an unusually high number of species. We want to double check with you that the checklist follows <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, in particular:
- Correspond to a single calendar date: checklists should not span multiple
days. <b>Were all species seen/heard from the start time of your checklist up to the duration set in your checklist?</b>
- Correspond to a single map location: birds from different map regions should not be combined on one list. <b>Were all species reported seen/heard within the distance set in your checklist, centered around the location of the checklist?</b> 
- Correspond to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859-guide-to-ebird-protocols">appropriate protocol</a>.

Could you please make the relevant corrections so that the checklist follows these guidelines, and let me know when done, so that I can set the checklist as public again?

Thanks in advance,

RaphaÃ«l Nussbaumer
