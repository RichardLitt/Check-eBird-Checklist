Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S61223176' target='_blank'>S61223176</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S61526270' target='_blank'>S61526270</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S61927845' target='_blank'>S61927845</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S63057082' target='_blank'>S63057082</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S65837683' target='_blank'>S65837683</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because we suspect a potential issue with the duration entered. Could you double check the value entered and verify the validity of the protocol selected according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>?

Please let me know when you have made the appropriate correction so I can set the checklist as public again.

Thanks in advance, 

Raphaël Nussbaumer
