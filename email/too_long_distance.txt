Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30702691' target='_blank'>S30702691</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30708077' target='_blank'>S30708077</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30708149' target='_blank'>S30708149</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30702567' target='_blank'>S30702567</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30686161' target='_blank'>S30686161</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30685137' target='_blank'>S30685137</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30702672' target='_blank'>S30702672</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30685833' target='_blank'>S30685833</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30686306' target='_blank'>S30686306</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30701407' target='_blank'>S30701407</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30701438' target='_blank'>S30701438</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30685271' target='_blank'>S30685271</a>, <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S30685225' target='_blank'>S30685225</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because it as an usually high distance. While it is acceptable to make a checklist of up to 80km according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, more precise checklists are more valuable for science. It is therefore recommend to keep Traveling checklists under 5 miles (8 km) and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or one mile provides even more checklist precision! 

Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives in between. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

In light of the above, could you please check that the location, duration, distance and protocol of your checklist are correct, and let me know when done, so that I can set the checklist as public again?

Thanks in advance,

Raphaël Nussbaumer

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S56810130' target='_blank'>S56810130</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because it as an usually high distance. While it is acceptable to make a checklist of up to 80km according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, more precise checklists are more valuable for science. It is therefore recommend to keep Traveling checklists under 5 miles (8 km) and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or one mile provides even more checklist precision! 

Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives in between. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

In light of the above, could you please check that the location, duration, distance and protocol of your checklist are correct, and let me know when done, so that I can set the checklist as public again?

Thanks in advance,

Dear [name],

Thank you for being a part of eBird. To help make sure that eBird can be used for scientific research and conservation, volunteers like me follow up on unusual observations as a part of the eBird data quality process.

I am writing about the following checklist(s): <a href='https://ebird.org/checklist/S33341920' target='_blank'>S33341920,S38615358</a>

Your checklist(s) was flagged because it as an usually high distance. While it is acceptable to make a checklist of up to 80km according to the <a href="https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices">eBird rules and best practices</a>, more precise checklists are more valuable for science. It is therefore recommend to keep Traveling checklists under 5 miles (8 km) and Stationary checklists under 3 hours for your sightings to make the biggest impact for science. Limiting your checklists to less than one hour or one mile provides even more checklist precision! 

Please do not submit one checklist spanning several locations, especially when those locations were separated by long drives in between. A good rule of thumb is: every time you get in a car, stop the previous list and start a new list at the next location.

In light of the above, could you please check that the location, duration, distance and protocol of your checklist are correct, and let me know when done, so that I can set the checklist as public again?

Thanks in advance,

Raphaël Nussbaumer
