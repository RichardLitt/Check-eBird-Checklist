    "text": "Introduction\nAccording to the eBird Volunteer Roles and Expectations, eBird checklist reviewers are responsible for tagging eBird Checklists as Public or Not Public, following eBird standards:\n\n\nEvaluate entire eBird checklists to verify that checklist location, date, protocol, and other details are accurate. \nEnsure that distance and duration are not excessively long for the situation and that checklists do not otherwise violate eBird data quality guidelines—holding observers to a uniform standard as outlined in the eBird Central guidelines. \nWhen checklists marked Not Public could be improved and displayed publicly, inform the checklist owner of the necessary changes that would make their list(s) appropriate for public display.\nWork with eBird Observation Reviewers and eBird Mentors when checklist-level data quality raises concerns about an observer’s eBird understanding, willingness, or ability to contribute useful data for eBird.\nMaintain comprehensive understanding of eBird checklist review policies and follow those standards in the review process.\n\n\nThese responsibilities can be difficult to implement in practice as there is no tool to identify checklists violating eBird data quality guidelines. Below, we propose a series of checks that can be performed to identify these checklists using the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD)."

    "section": "How to review checklists",
    "text": "How to review checklists\nDetailed explanations on how to review checklists are provided in the eBird Reviewer Handbook:\n\n\nChecklist-Date Imprecise: Use this when an observer submits records from a correct location, but uses a date that is clearly incorrect. Some users submit lists spanning multiple days. eBird does not accept multi-day lists and it is best to make these checklists Not Public using this reason, even if they are otherwise correct. Obvious list-building efforts should be invalidated as Checklist-List Building and incorrectly plotted locations should be made Not Public using one of the Location review reasons below.\nChecklist-Distance Too Long: Mainland checklists of 80.5 km (50.0 miles) or longer, or High Seas checklists (https://ebird.org/region/XX) of 160.9 km (100.0 miles) or longer, are automatically tagged as Checklist-Distance Too Long. Reviewers can override this in rare cases, and if observers correct a typo (e.g., change 50 miles to 5.0 miles) then the checklist can be marked Public by a reviewer; editing the distance does not reverse the automatic tagging.\nOne goal of review is to ensure that correctly identified records are plotted reasonably accurately, so that display on a map will not misrepresent the species’ range. In general, we believe that most checklists of 8 km (5 miles) or less should be accepted by reviewers and most checklists of 25 km (15 miles) or more should probably be marked Checklist-Distance Too Long, especially if they span multiple habitats. Reviewers must use their best judgment in all cases to not be overly restrictive, but to also steer observers towards shorter and more precise lists.\nChecklist-Error: This reason is to be used for miscellaneous issues with the checklist that are not covered by the other review reasons (one example would be a checklist reporting entirely captive birds from a zoo). This reason should almost always be accompanied by review notes explaining why the checklist was considered Not Public.\nChecklist-List Building: It is common for observers to create a life list or a state list by plotting a location or selecting a random point, picking a random date, and submitting a full list of what they’ve seen over the course of a lifetime or a trip to a given country or state. These do not represent serious attempts to submit data worthy of a scientific database, so these should be made Not Public. Records from these often are easily caught by our filters, and anytime these are identified the entire list should be marked Not Public with this reason. Note that we do formally recommend that users submit such lists using the date of 1 Jan 1900 (see the Enter your pre- eBird life list article) and records from this date are automatically tagged as Checklist-List Building and marked Not Public. If you encounter users entering different dates for such lists, please steer them to this article.\nChecklist-Multi-party: eBird is a system for collecting single-party checklists. If two or more observers go birding independently, these birding efforts should be submitted separately. If they are not, it is appropriate to make the list Not Public using this reason if the observer is unwilling to correct his or her list. Christmas Bird Count “sector” data is sometimes submitted this way as an aggregation from multiple independent parties, and this is the appropriate way to address those checklists.\nChecklist-Protocol Error: This reason is to be used when eBirders use protocols incorrectly. These could include custom protocols, like atlases or specialized surveys, or misuse of Traveling Count or Stationary count protocols. Also, Nocturnal flight call counts should use the special protocol since this makes assumptions about counts and detectability that do not affect eBird output. Please ask observers to change their Nocturnal Flight Call count submissions to this protocol; if they do not, marking them Not Public using this reason may be appropriate. Changing protocol does not automatically remove this tag, so this requires a reviewer.\nLocation-Issue: This review reason is to be used for any case where the observer has badly misplotted the location or has selected the incorrect location. Ideally, the reviewer would email the observer in such cases to inform him or her about the error. Note that use of country, state/province, or county-level locations (from “Submit for an entire country, state, county, or city”) will automatically treat checklists as Not Public using the appropriate review reason. For any Location review reason—including both reviewer-tagged checklists and automatically- tagged checklists—a correction of the location by the user (either a location move or selection of a different location) will remove this checklist-level flag. We assume in such cases that the observer has made the appropriate correction and if not, these will need to be located again; we do not give reviewer notification in such cases."
